<h2>1. Project Purpose</h2>

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/282ff927-1586-4515-a50f-905585aebb8e"/>

Although South Korea boasts a variety of attractive tourist destinations, in reality, <strong>many tourists tend to concentrate on a few well-known spots</strong>. This leads to an imbalance in tourism across regions, leaving many local attractions underutilized.

Additionally, <strong>young travelers often focus on social media validation and consumption</strong>, resulting in travel experiences that are more about one-time consumption than meaningful interactions. This trend prompts a reevaluation of the true value of travel.

Therefore, this project aims to <strong>distribute tourist demand</strong> and <strong>highlight the charm of relatively overlooked local attractions to stimulate regional consumption</strong>. Furthermore, it seeks to propose a new travel culture where young people connect with local communities and contribute to regional vitality through their journeys.

<h2>2. Expected Outcomes</h2>

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4029e39-9880-41df-9882-e837e2addb8d"/>

Through this project, we aim to <strong>fulfill the meaningful travel desires of the younger generation</strong> and contribute to the <strong>spread of value-centered travel culture</strong>. Additionally, by creating content collaboratively with local residents and travelers, we strive to <strong>restore regional identity</strong>.

Moreover, to <strong>address social issues</strong>, we plan to offer special travel courses that allow users to experience the joy of volunteering, thereby aiming to <strong>enhance civic consciousness</strong>.

<h2>6. Troubleshooting</h2>

<h3>1. NoSuchFileException Occurs During File Upload</h3>

[Issue]<br>
Encountered NoSuchFileException when calling file.transferTo() during file upload.<br>
<br>
[Cause]<br>
Attempted to save file in /upload/yyyy/MM/dd directory that did not exist, leading to exception.<br>
Missing logic to create directory.<br>
<br>
  üí• Problematic Code

        file.transferTo(new File(rootPath, uuid.toString() + "_" + file.getOriginalFilename()));

[Solution]<br>
Check if the directory exists using File object, and create it with mkdirs() if it doesn't.<br>
<br>
  ‚úÖ Updated Code
  
        File directory = new File(rootPath);
        if (!directory.exists()) {
            directory.mkdirs(); // Create upload path if it doesn't exist
        }
        
        file.transferTo(new File(rootPath, uuid.toString() + "_" + file.getOriginalFilename()));

[Lesson Learned]<br>
It's crucial to verify the existence of directories before file uploads.<br>
In real server environments, system factors like disk paths and permissions can also cause errors.<br>
Hence, it's important to habitually check directories before calling transferTo().<br>

<h3>2. NullPointerException When Sending Message Without File Attachment</h3>

[Issue]<br>
Encountered NullPointerException at file.getOriginalFilename().equals("") when sending a message without a file.<br>
<br>
[Cause]<br>
When MultipartFile is null or not attached, getOriginalFilename() can return null, leading to exception when .equals("") is called.<br>
<br>
   üí• Problematic Code
    
        if (file.getOriginalFilename().equals("")) {
        // Handle no file
        }

file or file.getOriginalFilename() being null can cause NPE<br>
<br>
[Solution]<br>
Safely handle conditions by checking MultipartFile's isEmpty() and null or empty getOriginalFilename().<br>
<br>
  ‚úÖ Updated Code

          if (file == null || file.isEmpty()) {
          log.warn("File is empty.");
          } else {
              log.info("File name: {}", file.getOriginalFilename());
          }

[Lesson Learned]<br>
Always assume that externally received objects can be incomplete,<br>
and write defensive code considering null safety.<br>
Especially for input-based features like file uploads, avoid directly calling methods like .equals() or .get() without prior checks.<br>

<h3>3. Message Sending Fails Due to Missing Recipient Email Information</h3>

[Issue]<br>
Attempting to send a message to a non-existent email could lead to NoSuchElementException due to direct call to Optional.get().<br>
<br>
[Cause]<br>
memberDAO.findIdByEmail() may return Optional.empty, but the code directly calls .get() without exception handling.<br>
<br>
  üí• Problematic Code

        Long receiverId = memberDAO.findIdByEmail(sendMessageDTO.getReceiverEmail()).get();

If findIdByEmail() doesn't return a result, calling get() causes exception<br>
<br>
[Solution]<br>
First check if Optional is empty or present, and display error message to user if no result.<br>
<br>
  ‚úÖ Updated Code

        Optional<Long> receiverId = memberDAO.findIdByEmail(sendMessageDTO.getReceiverEmail());
        if (receiverId.isEmpty()) {
            redirectAttributes.addFlashAttribute("error", "Recipient email not found.");
            return "redirect:/my-page/messageWrite";
        }
        
        sendMessageDTO.setReceiverId(receiverId.get());

[Lesson Learned]<br>
Optional is not just a tool to hide nulls,<br>
but a means for safe and explicit value handling.<br>
Instead of always using .get(), learn to use isEmpty(), orElseThrow(), orElseGet(), ifPresent(), etc., as appropriate.<br>
